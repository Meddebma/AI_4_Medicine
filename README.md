# AI_4_Medicine

Hello, I am a radiologist and researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have created this repository to share my research with the community and to collaborate with others who are interested in AI and its applications in radiology.

In this repository, you will find various notebooks that I have created during my research. These notebooks cover a wide range of topics related to AI in radiology, including image segmentation, classification, and deep learning.

I am constantly updating this repository as I work on new projects and experiments, so please check back often for the latest updates. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find my work useful and informative.
